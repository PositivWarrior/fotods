                <p className="text-secondary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  I believe that great interior photography is about more than just documenting a spaceâ€”it's about 
                  capturing its essence, character, and the feeling it evokes. Every room tells a story, and my 
                  mission is to convey that narrative through carefully composed, beautifully lit images.
                </p>
                <p className="text-secondary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  With each project, I strive to highlight the unique features and design elements that make a space 
                  special. Whether it's the way natural light streams through windows, the texture of materials, or 
                  the thoughtful details of interior design, I ensure these aspects shine in my photography.
                </p>
                <p className="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                  My technical approach combines traditional photography skills with modern digital techniques, 
                  allowing me to deliver images that are both authentic to the space and optimized for their intended use, 
                  whether for real estate listings, design portfolios, or architectural publications.
